Born Nov. 14, 1799, at Theresa, Jefferson Co., New York, to Benenio Patten and Abigail Cole. Ordained apostle Feb. 15, 1835, under the hands of Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, at Kirtland, Ohio, at age 35; killed Oct. 25, 1838, at the Battle of Crooked River, Missouri, at age 38. Note: David Patten was actually older than Thomas B. Marsh when called to the Twelve, but he did not know his age at that time. Subsequent records showed he was actually older by almost a year.
